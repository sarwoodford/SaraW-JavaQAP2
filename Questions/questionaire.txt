working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can -
 an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

A: around 3 hours. The simpler classes like Address and Person took around 5 minutes 
and more complex classes like Money took up most of my time becuase i had to research
unfamilliar topics, probably close to 30-45 mins. 

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

A: StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks, W3Schools

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. 
(If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your 
class fellows.)

A: no

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors?
 If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions 
 did you require)?

A: no

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own
 perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar
  but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future
   now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

A: Probelm #1 - 2/10, could confidently do a similar question

   Problem #2 - 3/10, confused me a little to start but could
                      confidently do a similar question now
                      
   Problem #3 - 6.5/10, required some research and more thinking
                        but i could do another similar problem, may
                        have to refer back to this one for some guidance
